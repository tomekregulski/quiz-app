# Description

This is a simple, multiple-choice quiz app. Upon pressing "start", the user is present with a question and four answer choices. Choosing an incorrect answer will display a brief "wrong!" message, and subtract 4 seconds from the time remaining. Choosing a correct answer will display a brief "correct!" message, increase the score by 1, and display a new question. The game concludes once the timer reaches 0, or if the user manages to answer all the questions. At this point, the user's final score is displayed, and they are given the chance to submit their name. If the score is the new high score, then the user's name and score will be displayed as the high score.

This page has been deployed on Github as a work-in-progress, and can be viewed here:  https://tomekregulski.github.io/quiz-app/

# What I Learned

This project has served to not only solidify what I have learned about HTML and CSS thus far, but also challenged me to expand my working knowledge of the languages in order to meet the functionality requirements.

I am excited to know that I am now capable of producing an elegant site that is responsive to different screen sizes, makes use of makes use of pseudo classes to enhance certain parts of the user experience, and even make use of a few lines of JavaScript/jQuery to include a collapsible menu for smaller screens. Additionally, this project helped me gain confidence in turning to the online community for solutions to specific design and functionality issues.
