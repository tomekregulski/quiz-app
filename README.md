# Description

This is a simple, multiple-choice quiz app, developed with the intention of becoming a template for companies to administer onboarding tests. Upon pressing "start", the user is present with a question and four answer choices. Choosing an incorrect answer will display a brief "wrong!" message; whereas choosing a correct answer will display a brief "correct!" message, and display a new question. The game concludes once the all the questions have been answered. Upon completion, the user submits their name and score, which will be stored so management can review and follow up if needed. The user is then presented with a final message thanking them for their time and giving instructions for any next steps.

This page has been deployed on Github, and can be viewed here: https://tomekregulski.github.io/quiz-app/

# Next Steps

The styling is at a mid-point. I will likely remove Bootstrap and redo everything from scrath to make it all more flexible. Additionally, I would like to add a database so scores can be tracked over time. Finally, and ultiamtely, I hope to add functionality that allows multiple quizzes to be created and edited over time through a form.

# Installation and Use

Clone the repo and open the folder in the code editor of your choice.
