# Description

This is a simple, multiple-choice quiz app, developed with the intention of becoming a template for companies to administer onboarding tests. Upon pressing "start", the user is present with a question and four answer choices. Choosing an incorrect answer will display a brief "wrong!" message; whereas choosing a correct answer will display a brief "correct!" message, and display a new question. The game concludes once the all the questions have been answered. Upon completion, the user submits their name and score, which will be stored so management can review and follow up if needed. The user is then presented with a final message thanking them for their time and giving instructions for any next steps. 

This page has been deployed on Github, and can be viewed here:  https://tomekregulski.github.io/quiz-app/

# Next Steps

-The styling is at a mid-point. I will likely remove Bootstrap and redo everything from scrath to make it all more flexible. 
-There is some functionality left over from a previous approach to how score is kept, and how the user progrersses through the quiz. This needs to be updated in order to be in line with the current objectives of this app.
