# Description

This is a simple, multiple-choice quiz app. Upon pressing "start", the user is present with a question and four answer choices. Choosing an incorrect answer will display a brief "wrong!" message, and subtract 4 seconds from the time remaining. Choosing a correct answer will display a brief "correct!" message, increase the score by 1, and display a new question. The game concludes once the timer reaches 0, or if the user manages to answer all the questions. At this point, the user's final score is displayed, and they are given the chance to submit their name. If the score is the new high score, then the user's name and score will be displayed as the high score.

This page has been deployed on Github as a work-in-progress, and can be viewed here:  https://tomekregulski.github.io/quiz-app/
